# Code Navigation

## Go to Definition

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: go_to_definition -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Cross-TU go-to-definition**

A use in one translation unit resolves to the definition supplied by a
sibling source — the answer spans the project, not the current file alone

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/01_def_cross_tu/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Definition and declaration alternate**

Navigation alternates between a declaration and definition

A request from a use reaches the definition, while requests at the
declaration or definition reach the other site. An inline symbol with
no separate declaration keeps its definition as the answer.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/02_def_decl_alternate.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Declaration-only navigation**

Symbols that carry only a declaration — pure virtuals, `extern` variables,
in-class static constants — resolve to that declaration instead of returning
nothing

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/03_def_declaration_only.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Go-to-definition on `#include` directives**

Go-to-definition on an include opens the referenced file

Leading includes and ordinary includes later in the file behave alike.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/04_def_include/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Local symbol navigation**

Go-to-definition on a local variable or parameter jumps to its declaration
inside the function body

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/05_def_local_symbol.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Macro wrapper navigation**

A name spelled in a macro argument anchors at its spelling, so definition
and declaration alternate there exactly as at a plain site, and a later use
resolves through the wrapper to the function it declares

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/06_def_macro_wrapper.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Macro-generated names**

A name assembled by token paste has no spelling of its own in the source, so
it anchors at the macro invocation that creates it: the invocation is its
definition site, and a plain use of the name jumps back to that invocation

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/07_def_macro_generated.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Macro body navigation**

A token written inside a macro body has no meaning until an expansion
assigns one, so navigation on it yields nothing, while the invocation token
always resolves to the macro being expanded

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/08_def_macro_body.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Error recovery**

An unresolved variable type prevents navigation to the variable's
declaration

When a variable's type name fails to resolve, go-to-definition on a
later use of the variable currently returns nothing, even though the
variable's own declaration is still recorded.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/09_def_error_recovery.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Dependent member navigation**

Inside a template that is never instantiated, a member accessed on an object
of a dependent type resolves to the member declared on the corresponding
class template

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/10_def_dependent_type.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#212 -->

**Template specialization navigation**

Go-to-definition on the name of an explicit specialization resolves to the
specialization itself; stepping from it to the primary template it
specializes is not offered

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/11_def_template_spec.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#2055 -->

**Deduced `auto` type navigation**

The `auto` keyword does not navigate to its deduced type yet

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_definition/12_def_auto_keyword.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Implicit targets

Navigate to definitions of implicitly invoked code. In C++ many constructs generate hidden calls to constructors, operators, conversions, etc. Navigating from the syntactic construct (a brace, a keyword, an operator token) to the actual function being called is essential for understanding what code is really executing.

Implicit navigation requires an unambiguous source token — patterns where the token already has a well-defined go-to-def target (e.g., a variable name always goes to its declaration) cannot be repurposed for implicit call navigation.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: implicit_targets -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**`override` / `final`**

`override` and `final` do not navigate to the overridden base method yet

Go-to-definition on the `override` or `final` specifier does not reach the
base class virtual method it overrides.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/01_override_final.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#1921 -->

**`break` / `continue`**

`break` and `continue` do not navigate to their enclosing control statement
yet

Go-to-definition on `break` or `continue` does not reach the head of the
loop or switch it controls.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/02_break_continue.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**`delete` expression**

`delete` does not navigate to the invoked destructor yet

Go-to-definition on `delete` does not reach the destructor it runs.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/03_delete_dtor.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**`new` expression**

`new` navigates to an overloaded allocation function but not the constructor

Go-to-definition on `new` reaches the class's overloaded `operator new`.
The constructor invoked by the same expression is not part of the reply.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/04_new_ctor.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Overloaded operators**

An overloaded operator token navigates to its definition

Go-to-definition on an overloaded operator token reaches the operator's
definition. The binary, subscript, call and arrow operators (`+`, `[]`,
`()`, `->`) are all resolved.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/05_operator_call.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**C++20 rewritten operators**

Rewritten comparisons navigate to the operator that implements them

For a comparison synthesized by the C++20 rewrite rules, go-to-definition
on the written operator reaches the operator that actually implements it:
`!=` reaches `operator==`, and `>` reaches `operator<=>`.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/06_rewritten_operator.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**User-defined literals**

A literal suffix does not navigate to its user-defined literal operator yet

Go-to-definition on a user-defined-literal suffix does not reach its
`operator""`.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/07_udl.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#1931 -->

**Implicit conversion operators**

Conversion contexts do not navigate to the invoked conversion operator yet

Go-to-definition from a context that runs a user-defined conversion (a
condition, `!`, an explicit `bool(...)`) does not reach the conversion
operator.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/08_conversion_context.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Cast conversion navigation**

Constructing casts navigate to the selected constructor

A `static_cast` that runs a user-defined conversion operator does not yet
reach that operator.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/09_cast_conversion.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Range-based for**

The range-for colon does not navigate to `begin()` or `end()` yet

Go-to-definition on the `:` of a range-based for does not reach the
`begin()` or `end()` chosen for the range.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/10_range_for.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**`co_await` / `co_yield` / `co_return`**

`co_yield` navigates to its promise method, while other coroutine keywords
do not

Go-to-definition on `co_yield` reaches the promise's `yield_value`. The
`co_await` and `co_return` keywords do not yet reach the awaiter's or
promise's methods.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_targets/11_coroutine.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Implicit Construction

Navigation from initialization, return, capture and decomposition syntax reaches
constructors, aggregate definitions or bindings selected implicitly.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: implicit_construction -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Constructor calls**

Parentheses and braces navigate to the selected constructor

Go-to-definition on the opening parenthesis or brace of a constructor
call reaches the constructor overload resolution selected, for both the
`T(args)` and `T{args}` forms.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/01_constructor_call.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Copy/move construction and assignment**

Assignment `=` navigates to the assignment operator, while copy and move
initialization do not

Go-to-definition on the `=` of an assignment reaches the assignment
operator. The `=` that introduces a copy- or move-initialization
(`T b = a;`) is initialization syntax rather than an operator call and is
not yet resolved.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/02_copy_move.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**CTAD**

A CTAD construction navigates to the deduced specialization's constructor

When class template argument deduction picks a specialization, go-to-
definition on the constructor call reaches the constructor that was
selected, not merely the class template.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/03_ctad.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Aggregate initialization**

Aggregate initializer braces navigate to the aggregate definition

An aggregate has no constructor, so go-to-definition on its initializer
brace reaches the aggregate's definition.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/04_aggregate_init.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Member initializer list**

Member-initializer parentheses navigate to the selected base or member
constructor

The base and member constructors run by an initializer list are reached
from the opening parenthesis of each initializer. The initializer name
itself resolves to the base type or the member, so navigation to the
constructor goes through the parenthesis.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/05_member_init.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Delegating constructors**

Delegating-constructor parentheses navigate to the target constructor

A delegating constructor's target is reached from the opening parenthesis
of the delegated call. The constructor name itself resolves to the class
type, so navigation to the target constructor goes through the
parenthesis.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/06_delegating_ctor.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Inherited constructors**

An inherited-constructor declaration navigates to every imported base
constructor

Go-to-definition on an inherited-constructor declaration
(`using Base::Base;`) lists each constructor of the base it imports.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/07_inherited_ctor.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Return value implicit construction**

A braced return value navigates to the selected constructor

A braced `return {args}` implicitly constructs the function's return
type; go-to-definition on the brace reaches the selected constructor.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/08_return_construction.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Lambda init-capture**

A lambda init-capture does not navigate to its move constructor yet

Go-to-definition on the `=` of a lambda init-capture does not reach the
constructor that builds the captured value.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/09_lambda_capture.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Structured bindings**

Structured binding names navigate to the bindings, not underlying fields or
accessors

Go-to-definition on a structured binding name resolves to the binding
itself rather than the underlying field or accessor it names.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/implicit_construction/10_structured_binding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Go to Declaration

Navigate from a symbol usage or definition to its declaration. In C++, many entities have separate declarations and definitions.

clice returns the declaration locations plus the definition — symbols defined inline have no separate declaration — minus the site the cursor already stands on, so declaration and definition sites alternate just like go-to-definition.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: go_to_declaration -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Cross-TU go-to-declaration**

Go-to-declaration on a use resolves sites in other files: the prototype
lives in a shared header and the out-of-line definition in a sibling source,
and both are offered from a use in another file

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_declaration/01_decl_cross_tu/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Functions**

Uses and out-of-line definitions navigate to the function prototype

Go-to-declaration reaches a function's prototype both from a call site
and from the out-of-line definition — the two non-cursor sites the
prototype alternates with.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_declaration/02_decl_function_prototype.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Forward-declared record types**

A class with a forward declaration and a later definition offers both from a
use — the forward declaration stays part of the declaration set rather than
being dropped in favour of the definition

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_declaration/03_decl_forward_class.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Static data member**

Static member uses navigate to the in-class declaration

A static data member is declared inside the class and defined out of
line; go-to-declaration on a use offers the in-class declaration
alongside the definition.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_declaration/04_decl_static_member.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**`extern` variable**

External variable uses navigate to their declaration

A use of an `extern` variable offers the `extern` declaration and
the defining declaration together, so the header-side declaration is
always reachable from a use.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_declaration/05_decl_extern_variable.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Multiple declarations**

A use navigates to every declaration site

When an entity is declared in several places, go-to-declaration on a
use lists every declaration site, not only the nearest one.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_declaration/06_decl_multiple.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Cosmetic signature differences**

Parameter names, and a top-level `const` on a parameter, are not part of a
function's type: the declaration and the definition below spell the same
function differently, yet go-to-declaration still connects a use to the
prototype

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_declaration/07_decl_signature_mismatch.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Go to Implementation

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: go_to_implementation -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Override chain**

Implementation navigation follows an override chain one level at a time

Along a three-level override chain, go-to-implementation from each method
reaches the override one level down — base to middle, middle to leaf.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_implementation/01_impl_virtual_chain.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Sibling overrides**

Implementation navigation lists every sibling override

Go-to-implementation on a virtual method lists every override across
the sibling derived classes.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_implementation/02_impl_virtual_siblings.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#854 -->

**Non-virtual function**

Non-virtual declarations do not navigate to out-of-line definitions yet

Go-to-implementation on a non-virtual function declaration does not reach
its out-of-line definition and returns nothing.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_implementation/03_impl_nonvirtual_def.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Base class**

Base classes navigate to every derived class

Go-to-implementation on a base class name lists the classes that derive
from it.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_implementation/04_impl_base_derived.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Template duck-type navigation**

Dependent calls do not resolve to methods of known instantiations yet

This applies to function templates and generic lambdas, but neither
currently returns an implementation target.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_implementation/05_impl_template_duck_type.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Go to Type Definition

Navigate to the type definition of a symbol. Applicable to variables, parameters, fields, and any other named entity that has a type. When the type is a type alias or a pointer-like wrapper, navigation should unwrap to the underlying/pointee type.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: go_to_type_definition -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Variables and parameters**

Go-to-type-definition on a local variable or a parameter reaches the
definition of its type

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_type_definition/01_typedef_variables.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Class and struct fields**

Go-to-type-definition on a field access reaches the definition of the
field's type

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_type_definition/02_typedef_field.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**`auto`-deduced variables**

Auto-deduced variables do not navigate to their deduced type definitions yet

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_type_definition/03_typedef_auto.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial clangd#1026 -->

**Smart-pointer pointee navigation**

Go-to-type-definition on a smart-pointer variable reaches the wrapper type
itself; unwrapping to the pointee type is not offered

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_type_definition/04_typedef_smart_pointer.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Type aliases**

Go-to-type-definition on a variable of an aliased type reaches the `using`
or `typedef` declaration; it does not yet unwrap the alias to the underlying
type's definition

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_type_definition/05_typedef_alias.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Structured binding variables**

Go-to-type-definition on a structured binding reaches the definition of the
bound member's type

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_type_definition/06_typedef_structured_binding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Pointers, references and arrays**

Go-to-type-definition looks through pointers, references and arrays to the
definition of the element type

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/go_to_type_definition/07_typedef_pointer_reference.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Find References

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: find_references -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Cross-TU find references**

Find references gathers uses from other files too: a function defined in one
source and called from a sibling reports both call sites together with the
declaration in the shared header, not only the uses in the current file

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/01_refs_cross_tu/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Declarations among references**

A reference query returns the declaration and the out-of-line definition
together with every use, so the whole surface of a symbol is reachable from
any one of its sites

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/02_refs_include_declaration.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#1081 -->

**Range-for references**

Find references on `begin` reports only its own declaration; the range-based
for loop that implicitly calls it is not included among the references

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/03_refs_range_for.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Implicit constructor and destructor calls**

Find references on a constructor reports only its explicit sites; an object
definition that implicitly invokes the constructor or its destructor is not
included

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/04_refs_implicit_construction.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#716 clangd#1872 -->

**References through forwarding functions**

Find references on a constructor does not include call sites that reach it
indirectly through a perfect-forwarding factory

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/05_refs_forwarding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#258 clangd#675 -->

**Dependent template references**

Find references on a member does not include dependent call sites in a
template, even when the template is instantiated with the member's class

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/06_refs_dependent_context.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#2139 -->

**Read/write classification of references**

The reference reply carries only locations, so a reader cannot tell a write
from a read; annotating each result with its access kind is not offered

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/07_refs_read_write.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#177 -->

**Reference enclosing context**

Each reference is reported as a bare location; the name of the function that
encloses it is not attached, so results carry no context beyond the file and
line

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/08_refs_enclosing_context.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Macro references**

Macro reference searches include expansions, conditional tests and
undefinitions

Each `#define` of a name is its own symbol, so a redefinition after
`#undef` collects only its own uses.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/09_refs_macro.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#346 -->

**Nested macro references**

Find references on a macro does not include the mentions of it written
inside the bodies of other macro definitions

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/10_refs_macro_in_macro.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Label and goto references**

Find references on a label lists the label itself together with every `goto`
that jumps to it

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/find_references/11_refs_label_goto.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Call Hierarchy

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: call_hierarchy -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Call hierarchy preparation**

Preparing a call hierarchy works on a free function and on a member method
alike, anchoring an item at the entity under the cursor

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/01_calls_prepare.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Incoming calls**

Incoming calls list every caller of a function, and a caller that invokes it
more than once contributes each call site

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/02_calls_incoming.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Outgoing calls**

Outgoing calls list every function a body invokes, one entry per callee

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/03_calls_outgoing.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Call hierarchy item details**

A call hierarchy item carries only its name; the function signature is not
attached in a detail field, so overloads are indistinguishable in the
hierarchy

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/04_calls_detail_signature.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Qualified name for member functions**

A member function's call hierarchy item is produced, but its name field
carries only the bare method name (`draw`), not the qualified `Circle::draw`
that would tell it apart from a free function

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/05_calls_qualified_name.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Follow virtual dispatch**

Incoming calls of a base virtual method do not include calls made through
derived overrides; a call to an override is attributed only to that
override, never to the base it overrides

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/06_calls_virtual_dispatch.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#1308 -->

**Non-function targets**

Call hierarchy preparation returns nothing for variables and enum constants

Preparing a call hierarchy on a variable or an enum constant returns
nothing; the request is offered only for functions and methods.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/07_calls_non_function.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Calls inside lambdas**

A call written in a lambda body appears in the incoming calls of the
function it invokes, attributed to the function that encloses the lambda

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/08_calls_lambda.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#2242 -->

**Constructor calls through forwarding functions**

Incoming calls of a constructor do not include the call sites that reach it
through a perfect-forwarding factory

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/call_hierarchy/09_calls_forwarding_ctor.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Type Hierarchy

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: type_hierarchy -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Type hierarchy preparation**

Preparing a type hierarchy anchors an item on any user-defined type tag —
class, struct, enum and union alike

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/type_hierarchy/01_types_prepare.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Supertypes**

Supertypes list every direct base of a class, including each base of a
multiple-inheritance derived type

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/type_hierarchy/02_types_supertypes.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Subtypes**

Subtypes list every class that derives from a base, across sibling derived
types

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/type_hierarchy/03_types_subtypes.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Template inheritance**

Subtypes of a base include classes that derive from it through a class
template, such as a CRTP wrapper

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/type_hierarchy/04_types_template_inheritance.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial clangd#31 -->

**Template arguments in hierarchy**

A subtype produced by a class template specialization is listed, but its
item name carries only the bare template name (`Derived`), without the
template arguments that would distinguish `Derived<Foo>`

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/type_hierarchy/05_types_template_args.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Workspace Symbol

Search the whole project for a symbol by name (`workspace/symbol`).

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: workspace_symbol -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Basic workspace-wide symbol search**

Workspace symbol search matches names regardless of case

A query matches a symbol's name as a subsequence aligned to its words,
ignoring case: functions, types, enumerators and macros all
participate, and a query with no match returns an empty list rather
than an error.

```snap
tests/snap/workspace_symbol/workspace_symbol/01_basic_search.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Search spans the whole project**

Workspace symbol search returns hits from unopened project files

The query returns symbols from project files that are not even open
in the editor: `other.h` stays closed here, so its hit is served by
the background index.

```snap
tests/snap/workspace_symbol/workspace_symbol/02_cross_file_search/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial clangd#1344 -->

**Overload disambiguation**

Workspace symbol results omit parameter types, leaving overloads ambiguous

Querying an overloaded name finds every overload, but each entry
carries only the bare name — nothing tells the two `process` results
apart short of opening both locations.

```snap
tests/snap/workspace_symbol/workspace_symbol/03_overload_params.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported clangd#914 -->

**Fuzzy matching**

A query matches a name as a subsequence aligned to its words

`LinLis` finds `LinkedList` and `pconf` finds `parse_config`: after its
first letter, every letter of the query either continues a run or starts
a word of the name, so `pcfg` finds nothing — its `f` lands in the middle
of `config`. The name spelled exactly ranks first, then the names
starting with the query, then matches deeper inside a name.

**Qualified name search**

A qualified query names the containers the symbol must lie in

`net::Socket` finds `deep::net::Socket`: the qualifiers must appear in the
symbol's container chain in that order, with other containers allowed
around them, while a leading `::` demands exactly that chain. Replies to
a qualified query spell the qualified name, so editors that filter
results against the query text keep them.

```

**Scoped enumerator lookup**

An enum qualifies its enumerators like any other container

```snap
tests/snap/workspace_symbol/workspace_symbol/06_enum_scope.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported clangd#2253 -->

**Alias ranking**

The name spelled exactly ranks above the names merely starting with it

`Connection` lists the alias first and `ConnectionImpl` after it.

```snap
tests/snap/workspace_symbol/workspace_symbol/07_alias_priority.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Search by mangled (linker) name**

Mangled linker names do not resolve to their source functions yet

```snap
tests/snap/workspace_symbol/workspace_symbol/08_mangled_name.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Query syntax**

Quotes, wildcards, scopes and filters narrow a search

`"process"` matches the whole name only and `proc*` whatever it globs;
`io::*` lists a namespace's members and `io::**` its whole subtree;
`kind:function` keeps one kind. Terms combine, separated by spaces.

## Module Navigation

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: module_navigation -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported clangd#2310 -->

**Module import navigation**

Go-to-definition on the name in an `import` declaration opens the module
interface unit that exports it, and uses of an imported symbol reach its
definition in that unit

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/module_navigation/01_module_import_name/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Module partition navigation**

Go-to-definition on the partition name after the colon in a partition import
opens the partition unit that declares it

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/module_navigation/02_module_partition_import/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Module interface implementation navigation**

Go-to-definition on the module name in an implementation unit (`module m;`)
jumps to the interface unit that declares the module; the reverse direction,
from the interface name to the implementation, is not offered

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/module_navigation/03_module_iface_impl/main.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Dot-separated module name**

Only the leading segment of a dotted module name navigates to its interface

Go-to-definition on the leading segment of a dot-separated module name
reaches the module's interface unit; the segments after a dot do not
resolve on their own yet.

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/module_navigation/04_module_dotted/main.cpp
```

## Document Highlight

Highlight all references to the symbol under cursor within the current file (`textDocument/documentHighlight`).

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: document_highlight -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Document reference highlights**

Document highlights are not implemented, so declarations and uses are not
highlighted

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/document_highlight/01_highlight_references.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Read/write classification for symbol highlights**

Document highlights do not report read and write access kinds yet

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/document_highlight/02_highlight_read_write.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#1921 -->

**Control flow token highlighting**

Control-flow keywords have no related document highlights yet

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/document_highlight/03_highlight_control_flow.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Switch Source/Header

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: switch_source_header -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Source-header switching**

Source/header switching is not implemented, so users cannot jump directly
between paired files

```snap
tests/snap/navigation/switch_source_header/01_switch_source_header.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->
