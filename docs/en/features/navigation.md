# Code Navigation

## Go to Definition

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Go to Definition -->

- [x] Cross-TU go-to-definition

  A use in one translation unit resolves to the definition supplied by
  a sibling source — the answer spans the project, not the current
  file alone.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "shared.h"

  int run(int value) {
      return transform(value);
  }
  ```

  `lib.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "shared.h"

  int transform(int value) {
      return value * 2;
  }
  ```

  `shared.h`:

  ```cpp
  #pragma once

  int transform(int value);
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Definition and declaration alternate at the cursor site

  On a use, go-to-definition reaches the definition. Invoked on the
  definition it steps to the declaration, and on the declaration it
  steps to the definition — the two sites alternate. A symbol defined
  inline, with no separate declaration, keeps its definition as the
  answer.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int scale(int value);

  int scale(int value) {
      return value * 2;
  }

  int apply(int value) {
      return scale(value);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Declaration-only symbols navigate to their declaration

  Symbols that carry only a declaration — pure virtuals, `extern`
  variables, in-class static constants — resolve to that declaration
  instead of returning nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  extern int threshold;

  int probe(int value);

  struct Screen {
      static const int margin = 4;
      virtual void refresh() = 0;
  };

  int watch(Screen& screen, int value) {
      screen.refresh();
      return probe(value) + threshold + Screen::margin;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Go-to-definition on `#include` directives

  Invoked on an `#include` line, go-to-definition opens the included
  file. This works for the leading includes compiled into the preamble
  (the PCH) as well as ordinary ones later in the file.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "panel.h"

  int build() {
      return dimension();
  }

  #include "extra.h"

  int total() {
      return build() + spacing();
  }
  ```

  `extra.h`:

  ```cpp
  inline int spacing() {
      return 2;
  }
  ```

  `panel.h`:

  ```cpp
  #pragma once

  int dimension();
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Local variables and parameters navigate to their declaration

  Go-to-definition on a local variable or parameter jumps to its
  declaration inside the function body.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int accumulate(int base) {
      int total = base;
      total = total + base;
      return total;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Navigate through macro wrappers to the underlying declaration

  A name spelled in a macro argument anchors at its spelling, so
  definition and declaration alternate there exactly as at a plain
  site, and a later use resolves through the wrapper to the function it
  declares.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  #define DECLARE_HOOK(name) int name(int value)

  DECLARE_HOOK(notify);

  DECLARE_HOOK(notify) {
      return value + 1;
  }

  int trigger(int value) {
      return notify(value);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Names conjured by a macro body or token paste anchor at the invocation

  A name assembled by token paste has no spelling of its own in the
  source, so it anchors at the macro invocation that creates it: the
  invocation is its definition site, and a plain use of the name jumps
  back to that invocation.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  #define MAKE_FLAG(name) bool flag_##name = false

  MAKE_FLAG(verbose);

  bool read_flag() {
      return flag_verbose;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Tokens inside a `#define` body carry no navigation of their own

  A token written inside a macro body has no meaning until an expansion
  assigns one, so navigation on it yields nothing, while the invocation
  token always resolves to the macro being expanded.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  #define DEFINE_COUNTER int counter = 0

  DEFINE_COUNTER;
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Error recovery — navigate to a variable whose type is unresolved

  When a variable's type name fails to resolve, go-to-definition on a
  later use of the variable currently returns nothing, even though the
  variable's own declaration is still recorded.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  Unresolved handle;  // 'Unresolved' does not name a type

  void read() {
      (void) handle;  // go-to-def on handle → the declaration above
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Dependent member navigation in uninstantiated templates

  Inside a template that is never instantiated, a member accessed on an
  object of a dependent type resolves to the member declared on the
  corresponding class template.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  struct Sink {
      void push(T value);
  };

  template <typename T>
  void drain(Sink<T>& sink, T value) {
      sink.push(value);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Template specialization navigates to the primary template ([clangd#212](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/212))

  Go-to-definition on the name of an explicit specialization resolves to
  the specialization itself; stepping from it to the primary template it
  specializes is not offered.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  struct Formatter {}; // primary template

  template <>
  struct Formatter<int> {}; // go-to-def on Formatter → primary template
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] `auto` keyword navigates to the deduced type ([clangd#2055](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2055))

  Go-to-definition on the `auto` keyword should reach the type it was
  deduced to; today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {};

  Widget make_widget();

  void use() {
      auto widget = make_widget(); // go-to-def on auto → Widget
  }
  ```

  </details>

### Implicit Code Navigation

Navigate to definitions of implicitly invoked code. In C++ many constructs generate hidden calls to constructors, operators, conversions, etc. Navigating from the syntactic construct (a brace, a keyword, an operator token) to the actual function being called is essential for understanding what code is really executing.

Implicit navigation requires an unambiguous source token — patterns where the token already has a well-defined go-to-def target (e.g., a variable name always goes to its declaration) cannot be repurposed for implicit call navigation.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Implicit Code Navigation -->

- [ ] `override` / `final` — navigate to the overridden base method

  Go-to-definition on the `override` or `final` specifier should reach the
  base class virtual method it overrides; today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Base {
      virtual void draw();
      virtual void paint();
  };

  struct Derived : Base {
      void draw() override;  // go-to-def on override → Base::draw
      void paint() final;    // go-to-def on final → Base::paint
  };
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] `break` / `continue` — navigate to the enclosing loop or switch head ([clangd#1921](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1921))

  Go-to-definition on `break` or `continue` should reach the head of the
  loop or switch it controls; today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  void loop() {
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
          if (i == 5) break;  // go-to-def on break → the for loop
          continue;           // go-to-def on continue → the for loop
      }
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Constructor calls — from parentheses or braces to the selected constructor

  Go-to-definition on the opening parenthesis or brace of a constructor
  call reaches the constructor overload resolution selected, for both the
  `T(args)` and `T{args}` forms.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      Widget(int w, int h);
  };

  void build() {
      Widget a(800, 600);
      Widget b{800, 600};
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Copy/move construction and assignment — to the constructor or assignment operator _(partial)_

  Go-to-definition on the `=` of an assignment reaches the assignment
  operator. The `=` that introduces a copy- or move-initialization
  (`T b = a;`) is initialization syntax rather than an operator call and is
  not yet resolved.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      Widget(int v);
      Widget(const Widget& other);
      Widget(Widget&& other);
      Widget& operator=(const Widget& other);
  };

  void copies(Widget a) {
      Widget b = a;
      Widget c = static_cast<Widget&&>(a);
      b = c;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] CTAD — navigate to the selected constructor

  When class template argument deduction picks a specialization, go-to-
  definition on the constructor call reaches the constructor that was
  selected, not merely the class template.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  struct Box {
      Box(T input) : value(input) {}
      T value;
  };

  template <typename T>
  Box(T) -> Box<T>;

  void use() {
      Box b(7);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Aggregate initialization — navigate to the struct definition

  An aggregate has no constructor, so go-to-definition on its initializer
  brace reaches the aggregate's definition.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Point {
      int x;
      int y;
  };

  void use() {
      auto p = Point{1, 2};
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] `delete` expression — navigate to the destructor

  Go-to-definition on `delete` should reach the destructor it runs; today
  it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      ~Widget();
  };

  void dispose(Widget* widget) {
      delete widget;  // go-to-def on delete → Widget::~Widget
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] `new` expression — navigate to the constructor and overloaded `operator new` _(partial)_

  Go-to-definition on `new` reaches the class's overloaded `operator new`.
  The constructor invoked by the same expression is not part of the reply.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Pool {
      Pool();
      static void* operator new(decltype(sizeof(0)) size);
  };

  void make() {
      Pool* p = new Pool();
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Member initializer list — navigate to base and member constructors _(partial)_

  The base and member constructors run by an initializer list are reached
  from the opening parenthesis of each initializer. The initializer name
  itself resolves to the base type or the member, so navigation to the
  constructor goes through the parenthesis.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Base {
      Base(int x);
  };

  struct Logger {
      Logger(int level);
  };

  struct App : Base {
      Logger logger;
      App() : Base(42), logger(1) {}
  };
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Delegating constructors — navigate to the target constructor _(partial)_

  A delegating constructor's target is reached from the opening parenthesis
  of the delegated call. The constructor name itself resolves to the class
  type, so navigation to the target constructor goes through the
  parenthesis.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      Widget(int w, int h);
      Widget() : Widget(0, 0) {}
  };
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Inherited constructors — navigate to the base constructors brought in by `using` _(partial)_

  Go-to-definition on an inherited-constructor declaration
  (`using Base::Base;`) reaches a base constructor. When the base declares
  several constructors the reply resolves to one of them rather than
  listing the whole set.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Base {
      Base(int x);
      Base(int x, int y);
  };

  struct Derived : Base {
      using Base::Base;
  };
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Return value implicit construction — navigate to the constructor

  A braced `return {args}` implicitly constructs the function's return
  type; go-to-definition on the brace reaches the selected constructor.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      Widget(int w, int h);
  };

  Widget create() {
      return {800, 600};
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Lambda init-capture — navigate to the constructor

  Go-to-definition on the `=` of a lambda init-capture should reach the
  constructor that builds the captured value; today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      Widget(int v);
      Widget(Widget&& other);
  };

  void use(Widget w) {
      // go-to-def on = → Widget(Widget&&)
      auto f = [x = static_cast<Widget&&>(w)] {};
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Overloaded operators — from the operator token to its definition

  Go-to-definition on an overloaded operator token reaches the operator's
  definition. The binary, subscript, call and arrow operators (`+`, `[]`,
  `()`, `->`) are all resolved.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Iterator {
      int value;
  };

  struct Vec {
      Vec operator+(const Vec& other) const;
      int operator[](int index) const;
      int operator()(int a, int b) const;
      Iterator* operator->();
  };

  void use(Vec a, Vec b) {
      Vec c = a + b;
      int e = a[0];
      int f = a(1, 2);
      a->value;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] C++20 rewritten operators — navigate to the operator the rewrite uses

  For a comparison synthesized by the C++20 rewrite rules, go-to-definition
  on the written operator reaches the operator that actually implements it:
  `!=` reaches `operator==`, and `>` reaches `operator<=>`.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  namespace std {
  struct strong_ordering {
      int n;
      constexpr operator int() const { return n; }
      static const strong_ordering equal, greater, less;
  };
  constexpr strong_ordering strong_ordering::equal = {0};
  constexpr strong_ordering strong_ordering::greater = {1};
  constexpr strong_ordering strong_ordering::less = {-1};
  }

  struct S {
      int value;
      bool operator==(const S& other) const;
      auto operator<=>(const S& other) const = default;
  };

  void use(S a, S b) {
      bool ne = a != b;
      bool gt = a > b;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] User-defined literals — navigate to the literal operator

  Go-to-definition on a user-defined-literal suffix should reach its
  `operator""`; today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Duration {
      unsigned long long ticks;
  };

  Duration operator""_ms(unsigned long long value);

  void use() {
      Duration d = 500_ms;  // go-to-def on _ms → operator""_ms
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Implicit conversion operators — from a conversion context to the operator ([clangd#1931](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1931))

  Go-to-definition from a context that runs a user-defined conversion (a
  condition, `!`, an explicit `bool(...)`) should reach the conversion
  operator; today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Guard {
      explicit operator bool() const;
  };

  void use(Guard g) {
      if (g) {}      // go-to-def on ( → Guard::operator bool
      bool ok = !g;  // go-to-def on ! → Guard::operator bool
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Casts invoking a constructor or conversion operator _(partial)_

  A `static_cast` that constructs its target reaches the selected
  constructor. A `static_cast` that runs a user-defined conversion operator
  does not yet reach the operator.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Meters {
      explicit operator double() const;
  };

  struct Foo {
      explicit Foo(int value);
  };

  void use(Meters m) {
      double d = static_cast<double>(m);
      Foo f = static_cast<Foo>(42);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Range-based for — navigate to `begin()` / `end()`

  Go-to-definition on the `:` of a range-based for should reach the
  `begin()` / `end()` chosen for the range; today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Iterator {
      int operator*() const;
      Iterator& operator++();
      bool operator!=(const Iterator& other) const;
  };

  struct Range {
      Iterator begin();
      Iterator end();
  };

  void use(Range r) {
      for (int x : r) {}  // go-to-def on : → Range::begin / Range::end
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Structured bindings — navigate to the underlying accessors or fields

  Go-to-definition on a structured binding name resolves to the binding
  itself rather than the underlying field or accessor it names.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Pair {
      int first;
      int second;
  };

  void use(Pair p) {
      // go-to-def on a → Pair::first, on b → Pair::second
      auto [a, b] = p;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] `co_await` / `co_yield` / `co_return` — navigate to the awaiter or promise method _(partial)_

  Go-to-definition on `co_yield` reaches the promise's `yield_value`. The
  `co_await` and `co_return` keywords do not yet reach the awaiter's or
  promise's methods.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  namespace std {
  template <typename Ret, typename...>
  struct coroutine_traits {
      using promise_type = typename Ret::promise_type;
  };
  template <typename = void>
  struct coroutine_handle {
      coroutine_handle() = default;
      template <typename Promise>
      coroutine_handle(coroutine_handle<Promise>) noexcept;
      static coroutine_handle from_address(void*) noexcept;
  };
  struct suspend_never {
      bool await_ready() const noexcept;
      void await_suspend(coroutine_handle<>) const noexcept;
      void await_resume() const noexcept;
  };
  }

  struct Awaiter {
      bool await_ready() const noexcept;
      void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<>) const noexcept;
      int await_resume() const noexcept;
  };

  struct Task {
      struct promise_type {
          Task get_return_object();
          std::suspend_never initial_suspend();
          std::suspend_never final_suspend() noexcept;
          Awaiter yield_value(int value);
          void return_value(int value);
          void unhandled_exception();
      };
  };

  Task example() {
      co_await Awaiter{};
      co_yield 1;
      co_return 2;
  }
  ```

## Go to Declaration

Navigate from a symbol usage or definition to its declaration. In C++, many entities have separate declarations and definitions.

clice returns the declaration locations plus the definition — symbols defined inline have no separate declaration — minus the site the cursor already stands on, so declaration and definition sites alternate just like go-to-definition.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Go to Declaration -->

- [x] Cross-TU go-to-declaration

  Go-to-declaration on a use resolves sites in other files: the
  prototype lives in a shared header and the out-of-line definition in a
  sibling source, and both are offered from a use in another file.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "shared.h"

  int run(int value) {
      return scale(value);
  }
  ```

  `lib.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "shared.h"

  int scale(int value) {
      return value * 2;
  }
  ```

  `shared.h`:

  ```cpp
  #pragma once

  int scale(int value);
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Functions — from a use or out-of-line definition to the prototype

  Go-to-declaration reaches a function's prototype both from a call site
  and from the out-of-line definition — the two non-cursor sites the
  prototype alternates with.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      void draw();
  };

  void Widget::draw() {}

  void render(Widget& widget) {
      widget.draw();
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Forward declarations of classes and structs

  A class with a forward declaration and a later definition offers both
  from a use — the forward declaration stays part of the declaration set
  rather than being dropped in favour of the definition.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget;

  struct Widget {
      int value;
  };

  class Panel;

  class Panel {
      int width;
  };

  int probe(Widget& widget, Panel& panel) {
      return widget.value;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Static data member — to the in-class declaration

  A static data member is declared inside the class and defined out of
  line; go-to-declaration on a use offers the in-class declaration
  alongside the definition.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Config {
      static int timeout;
  };

  int Config::timeout = 30;

  int read_config() {
      return Config::timeout;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] `extern` variable — to the declaration

  A use of an `extern` variable offers the `extern` declaration and
  the defining declaration together, so the header-side declaration is
  always reachable from a use.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  extern int log_level;

  int log_level = 0;

  int read_level() {
      return log_level;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Multiple declarations — every declaration site

  When an entity is declared in several places, go-to-declaration on a
  use lists every declaration site, not only the nearest one.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int clamp(int value);
  int clamp(int value);

  int clamp(int value) {
      return value < 0 ? 0 : value;
  }

  int hold(int value) {
      return clamp(value);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Declaration and definition with cosmetically different signatures

  Parameter names, and a top-level `const` on a parameter, are not part
  of a function's type: the declaration and the definition below spell the
  same function differently, yet go-to-declaration still connects a use to
  the prototype.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int render(int width, const int height);

  int render(int w, int h) {
      return w * h;
  }

  int use_render() {
      return render(800, 600);
  }
  ```

## Go to Implementation

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Go to Implementation -->

- [x] Virtual methods — each level of a chain to its own overriders

  Along a three-level override chain, go-to-implementation from each method
  reaches the override one level down — base to middle, middle to leaf.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Base {
      virtual void run() = 0;
  };

  struct Middle : Base {
      void run() override {}
  };

  struct Leaf : Middle {
      void run() override {}
  };
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Virtual method — every sibling override

  Go-to-implementation on a virtual method lists every override across
  the sibling derived classes.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Shape {
      virtual int area() = 0;
  };

  struct Circle : Shape {
      int area() override { return 1; }
  };

  struct Square : Shape {
      int area() override { return 2; }
  };

  struct Triangle : Shape {
      int area() override { return 3; }
  };
  ```

- [ ] Non-virtual function — declaration to out-of-line definition ([clangd#854](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/854))

  Go-to-implementation on a non-virtual function declaration should reach
  its out-of-line definition, behaving as a superset of go-to-definition;
  today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {
      void draw();  // go-to-impl on draw → out-of-line definition below
  };

  void Widget::draw() {}
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Base class — every derived class

  Go-to-implementation on a base class name lists the classes that derive
  from it.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Base {};

  struct Circle : Base {};

  struct Square : Base {};
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Template duck-type navigation

  From a dependent member call, go-to-implementation should list the
  concrete methods of every known instantiation; the same applies to a
  generic lambda's dependent calls. Today it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  void process(T& obj) {
      obj.foo();  // go-to-impl on foo → A::foo (from the process(a) instantiation)
  }

  struct A {
      void foo() {}
  };

  void run(A a) {
      process(a);
  }

  void generic() {
      auto call = [](auto& x) { x.bar(); };  // go-to-impl on bar → the concrete bar
  }
  ```

## Go to Type Definition

Navigate to the type definition of a symbol. Applicable to variables, parameters, fields, and any other named entity that has a type. When the type is a type alias or a pointer-like wrapper, navigation should unwrap to the underlying/pointee type.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Go to Type Definition -->

- [x] Variables and parameters

  Go-to-type-definition on a local variable or a parameter reaches the
  definition of its type.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {};

  Widget make_widget();

  int probe(Widget param) {
      Widget local = make_widget();
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Class and struct fields

  Go-to-type-definition on a field access reaches the definition of the
  field's type.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Logger {};

  class Store {};

  struct App {
      Logger logger;
      Store store;
  };

  int use(App& app) {
      app.logger;
      app.store;
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] `auto`-deduced variables

  Go-to-type-definition on an `auto`-deduced variable should reach the
  deduced type's definition; today the variable carries no type relation,
  so it returns nothing.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {};

  Widget make_widget();

  void probe() {
      auto widget = make_widget();  // go-to-type-def on widget → Widget
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Smart pointer to the pointee type _(partial)_ ([clangd#1026](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1026))

  Go-to-type-definition on a smart-pointer variable reaches the wrapper
  type itself; unwrapping to the pointee type is not offered.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  struct Ptr {
      T* operator->();
      T& operator*();
      T* raw;
  };

  struct Widget {};

  int use(Ptr<Widget> ptr) {
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Type aliases _(partial)_

  Go-to-type-definition on a variable of an aliased type reaches the
  `using` or `typedef` declaration; it does not yet unwrap the alias to
  the underlying type's definition.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Impl {};

  using Handle = Impl;

  typedef Impl LegacyHandle;

  int use(Handle handle, LegacyHandle legacy) {
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Structured binding variables

  Go-to-type-definition on a structured binding reaches the definition of
  the bound member's type.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Widget {};

  struct Pair {
      Widget first;
      int second;
  };

  Pair make_pair();

  int use() {
      auto [widget, count] = make_pair();
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  </details>

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Find References

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Find References -->

- [x] Cross-TU find references

  Find references gathers uses from other files too: a function
  defined in one source and called from a sibling reports both call
  sites together with the declaration in the shared header, not only the
  uses in the current file.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "shared.h"

  int run(int value) {
      return compute(value);
  }
  ```

  `lib.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "shared.h"

  int compute(int value) {
      return value * 2;
  }

  int again(int value) {
      return compute(value) + 1;
  }
  ```

  `shared.h`:

  ```cpp
  #pragma once

  int compute(int value);
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Declaration and definition sites appear among references

  A reference query returns the declaration and the out-of-line
  definition together with every use, so the whole surface of a symbol
  is reachable from any one of its sites.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int scale(int value);

  int scale(int value) {
      return value * 2;
  }

  int use() {
      return scale(3);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Implicit references from range-based for loops ([clangd#1081](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1081))

  Find references on `begin` reports only its own declaration; the
  range-based for loop that implicitly calls it is not included among the
  references.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Iterator {
      int operator*() const;
      Iterator& operator++();
      bool operator!=(const Iterator& other) const;
  };

  struct Range {
      Iterator begin();  // find-refs here omits the range-for below
      Iterator end();
  };

  void use(Range r) {
      for (int x : r) {
      }
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Implicit constructor and destructor calls

  Find references on a constructor reports only its explicit sites; an
  object definition that implicitly invokes the constructor or its
  destructor is not included.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Blob {
      Blob();  // find-refs here omits the `Blob b;` definition below
      ~Blob();
  };

  void use() {
      Blob b;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] References through forwarding functions ([clangd#716](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/716), [clangd#1872](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1872))

  Find references on a constructor does not include call sites that reach
  it indirectly through a perfect-forwarding factory.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  template <typename T, typename... Args>
  T make(Args&&... args) {
      return T(static_cast<Args&&>(args)...);
  }

  struct Widget {
      Widget(int w, int h);  // find-refs here omits the make<Widget> call
  };

  Widget build() {
      return make<Widget>(800, 600);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] References in dependent and template contexts ([clangd#258](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/258), [clangd#675](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/675))

  Find references on a member does not include dependent call sites in a
  template, even when the template is instantiated with the member's
  class.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct A {
      void foo();  // find-refs here omits the dependent obj.foo() below
  };

  template <typename T>
  void process(T& obj) {
      obj.foo();
  }

  void run(A a) {
      process(a);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Read/write classification of references ([clangd#2139](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2139))

  The reference reply carries only locations, so a reader cannot tell a
  write from a read; annotating each result with its access kind is not
  offered.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int use() {
      int x = 0;      // write
      int y = x + 1;  // read
      x = y;          // write
      return x;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Enclosing function shown with each reference ([clangd#177](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/177))

  Each reference is reported as a bare location; the name of the function
  that encloses it is not attached, so results carry no context beyond
  the file and line.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int shared_value = 0;

  int reader() {
      return shared_value;
  }

  int writer() {
      shared_value = 1;
      return shared_value;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Macro references across expansions, `#ifdef`/`#ifndef` and `#undef`

  A macro's references span its expansions, the `#ifdef` / `#ifndef`
  conditionals that test it and the `#undef` that cancels it. Each
  `#define` of a name is its own symbol, so a redefinition after `#undef`
  collects only its own uses.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  #define FEATURE 1

  int on = FEATURE;

  #ifdef FEATURE
  int guarded = 1;
  #endif

  #ifndef FEATURE
  int missing = 0;
  #endif

  #undef FEATURE

  #define FEATURE 2

  int again = FEATURE;
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Macro references spelled inside other macro definitions ([clangd#346](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/346))

  Find references on a macro does not include the mentions of it written
  inside the bodies of other macro definitions.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  #define WIDTH 100  // find-refs here omits the WIDTH tokens in AREA below

  #define AREA (WIDTH * WIDTH)

  int total = AREA;
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Label and goto references

  Find references on a label lists the label itself together with every
  `goto` that jumps to it.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int loop(int failed) {
      retry:
      if (failed) {
          goto retry;
      }
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  </details>

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Call Hierarchy

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Call Hierarchy -->

- [x] Prepare call hierarchy on functions and methods

  Preparing a call hierarchy works on a free function and on a member
  method alike, anchoring an item at the entity under the cursor.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Service {
      void start();
  };

  void Service::start() {}

  void launch(Service& s) {
      s.start();
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Incoming calls

  Incoming calls list every caller of a function, and a caller that
  invokes it more than once contributes each call site.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int helper(int v) {
      return v;
  }

  int alpha() {
      return helper(1);
  }

  int beta() {
      return helper(2) + helper(3);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Outgoing calls

  Outgoing calls list every function a body invokes, one entry per
  callee.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int one() {
      return 1;
  }

  int two() {
      return 2;
  }

  int three() {
      return 3;
  }

  int dispatch() {
      return one() + two() + three();
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Function signature in the item detail

  A call hierarchy item carries only its name; the function signature is
  not attached in a detail field, so overloads are indistinguishable in
  the hierarchy.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int compute(int a, int b) {  // no signature attached to this item
      return a + b;
  }

  int caller() {
      return compute(1, 2);
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Qualified name for member functions _(partial)_

  A member function's call hierarchy item is produced, but its name field
  carries only the bare method name (`draw`), not the qualified
  `Circle::draw` that would tell it apart from a free function.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Circle {
      void draw();
  };

  void Circle::draw() {}
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Follow virtual dispatch

  Incoming calls of a base virtual method do not include calls made
  through derived overrides; a call to an override is attributed only to
  that override, never to the base it overrides.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Base {
      virtual void draw();
  };

  struct Derived : Base {
      void draw() override;
  };

  void call_derived(Derived& d) {
      d.draw();  // absent from the incoming calls of Base::draw
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Non-function targets — variables and enum constants ([clangd#1308](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1308))

  Preparing a call hierarchy on a variable or an enum constant returns
  nothing; the request is offered only for functions and methods.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int counter = 0;  // prepare call hierarchy here → nothing

  enum Mode {
      Fast,  // prepare call hierarchy here → nothing
      Slow,
  };
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Calls inside lambdas

  A call written in a lambda body appears in the incoming calls of the
  function it invokes, attributed to the function that encloses the
  lambda.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  void foo() {}

  void use() {
      auto task = [] {
          foo();
      };
      task();
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Constructor calls through forwarding functions ([clangd#2242](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2242))

  Incoming calls of a constructor do not include the call sites that
  reach it through a perfect-forwarding factory.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  template <typename T, typename... Args>
  T make(Args&&... args) {
      return T(static_cast<Args&&>(args)...);
  }

  struct Widget {
      Widget(int w, int h);  // make<Widget> below is absent from incoming calls
  };

  Widget build() {
      return make<Widget>(800, 600);
  }
  ```

  </details>

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Type Hierarchy

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Type Hierarchy -->

- [x] Prepare type hierarchy on class, struct, enum and union

  Preparing a type hierarchy anchors an item on any user-defined type
  tag — class, struct, enum and union alike.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  class Handle {};

  struct Point {};

  enum class Mode {};

  union Storage {
      int i;
      float f;
  };
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Supertypes

  Supertypes list every direct base of a class, including each base of a
  multiple-inheritance derived type.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Alpha {};

  struct Beta {};

  struct Gamma : Alpha, Beta {};
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Subtypes

  Subtypes list every class that derives from a base, across sibling
  derived types.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Shape {};

  struct Circle : Shape {};

  struct Square : Shape {};

  struct Triangle : Shape {};
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Template inheritance

  Subtypes of a base include classes that derive from it through a class
  template, such as a CRTP wrapper.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Base {};

  template <typename T>
  struct CRTP : Base {};

  struct Widget : CRTP<Widget> {};
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Template arguments in type hierarchy items _(partial)_ ([clangd#31](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/31))

  A subtype produced by a class template specialization is listed, but
  its item name carries only the bare template name (`Derived`), without
  the template arguments that would distinguish `Derived<Foo>`.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  struct Foo {};

  struct Base {};

  template <typename T>
  struct Derived : Base {};

  Derived<Foo> instance;
  ```

  </details>

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Workspace Symbol

Search the whole project for a symbol by name (`workspace/symbol`).

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Workspace Symbol -->

- [x] Basic workspace-wide symbol search — case-insensitive substring matching

  A query matches any symbol whose name contains it, ignoring case:
  functions, types, enumerators and macros all participate, and a query
  with no match returns an empty list rather than an error.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // query: widget
  // query: parse_config
  // query: MODE
  // query: fast
  // query: no_such_symbol

  struct Widget {
      int width;
  };

  enum class Mode { Fast, Safe };

  #define MODE_DEFAULT 1

  void parse_config() {}
  ```

  </details>

- [x] Search spans the whole project — hits from files other than the queried one

  The query returns symbols from project files that are not even open
  in the editor: `other.h` stays closed here, so its hit is served by
  the background index.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  // query: helper_elsewhere

  int local_anchor = 0;
  ```

  `other.h`:

  ```cpp
  void helper_elsewhere() {}
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Overload disambiguation — parameter types shown in results _(partial)_ ([clangd#1344](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1344))

  Querying an overloaded name finds every overload, but each entry
  carries only the bare name — nothing tells the two `process` results
  apart short of opening both locations.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // query: process

  void process(int value) {}

  void process(bool flag, int level) {}
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Fuzzy matching — word-boundary-aware scoring for camelCase and snake_case ([clangd#914](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/914))

  Matching is a case-insensitive substring test: `LinLis` does not find
  `LinkedList`, and `pcfg` does not find `parse_config`. Word-boundary
  initials should match and score for every symbol kind, macros
  included.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // query: LinLis
  // query: pcfg

  struct LinkedList {};

  void parse_config();
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Partially qualified name search ([clangd#550](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/550))

  Symbols match by bare name only: `net::Socket` finds nothing even
  though `deep::net::Socket` exists, and neither does any other
  qualifier-prefixed form.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // query: net::Socket

  namespace deep {
  namespace net {

  struct Socket {};

  }  // namespace net
  }  // namespace deep
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Enumerator lookup under the enum's scope ([clangd#931](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/931))

  `Color::Red` should find the enumerator — for scoped and unscoped
  enums alike — but qualified queries match nothing; only the bare
  `Red` does.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // query: Color::Red

  enum Color { Red, Green };
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Underlying declarations ranked above type aliases ([clangd#2253](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2253))

  When both `ConnectionImpl` and its alias `Connection` match a query,
  the underlying declaration should rank first. Results carry no
  ranking today.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // query: Connection

  struct ConnectionImpl {};

  using Connection = ConnectionImpl;
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Search by mangled (linker) name

  Pasting a linker symbol such as `_Z7processi` should resolve to the
  function it mangles — useful when chasing linker errors and stack
  traces.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // query: _Z7processi

  void process(int value);
  ```

## Module Navigation

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Module Navigation -->

- [x] `import module_name` navigates to the module interface unit ([clangd#2310](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2310))

  Go-to-definition on the name in an `import` declaration opens the
  module interface unit that exports it, and uses of an imported symbol
  reach its definition in that unit.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  import widget;

  int build() {
      return area(2, 3);
  }
  ```

  `widget.cppm`:

  ```cpp
  export module widget;

  export int area(int width, int height) {
      return width * height;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [x] `import :partition` navigates to the partition unit

  Go-to-definition on the partition name after the colon in a partition
  import opens the partition unit that declares it.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  import pack;

  int run() {
      return count();
  }
  ```

  `pack.cppm`:

  ```cpp
  export module pack;

  export import :items;
  ```

  `pack_items.cppm`:

  ```cpp
  export module pack:items;

  export int count() {
      return 3;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Navigate between interface and implementation units of one module _(partial)_

  Go-to-definition on the module name in an implementation unit
  (`module m;`) jumps to the interface unit that declares the module;
  the reverse direction, from the interface name to the implementation,
  is not offered.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  import store;

  int lookup(int key) {
      return fetch(key);
  }
  ```

  `iface.cppm`:

  ```cpp
  export module store;

  export int fetch(int key);
  ```

  `impl.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  module store;

  int fetch(int key) {
      return key * 2;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Dot-separated module name — navigate each segment _(partial)_

  Go-to-definition on the leading segment of a dot-separated module name
  reaches the module's interface unit; the segments after a dot do not
  resolve on their own yet.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  import app.core;

  int run() {
      return value();
  }
  ```

  `app_core.cppm`:

  ```cpp
  export module app.core;

  export int value() {
      return 1;
  }
  ```

## Document Highlight

Highlight all references to the symbol under cursor within the current file (`textDocument/documentHighlight`).

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Document Highlight -->

- [ ] Highlight every reference to the symbol under the cursor in the current file

  Placing the cursor on `total` should light up its declaration and
  every use in the file; the request is not implemented.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  int total = 0;

  void accumulate(int amount) {
      total = total + amount;
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Read/write classification for symbol highlights

  Each highlight should carry its access kind, so editors can tint
  writes differently from reads.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  void tally() {
      int count = 0;      // write
      int next = count;   // read
      count = next;       // write
  }
  ```

  </details>

- [ ] Control flow token highlighting ([clangd#1921](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1921))

  Highlighting `break` or `continue` should also light up the loop or
  `switch` it belongs to — and `return` / `throw` the function exits
  they mark.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  void drain(int outer, int inner) {
      for (int i = 0; i < outer; i += 1) {
          for (int j = 0; j < inner; j += 1) {

## Switch Source/Header

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: Switch Source/Header -->

- [ ] Switch between a source file and its header

  From `widget.cpp` a single command should jump to `widget.h` and
  back — the `textDocument/switchSourceHeader` request clangd clients
  rely on is not implemented.

  <details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```cpp
  // widget.h
  class Widget {
      void draw();
  };

  // widget.cpp — #include "widget.h"
  void Widget::draw() {}
  ```
