# Folding Ranges

<!-- The capability sections below are generated from the snapshot fixtures in

## Fold Kinds

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: fold_kinds -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Block folding**

Functions, types, namespaces and lambdas form folding ranges

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/01_block_folding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Nested compound-statement folding**

Nested control-flow bodies form folding ranges

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/02_nested_compound_statement.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Multi-line list folding**

Multiline parameter, argument, initializer and capture lists form folding
ranges

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/03_multiline_list_folding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported clangd#1455 -->

**Access-specifier section folding**

Access-specifier regions within a class form folding ranges

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/04_access_specifier_folding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported clangd#1661 clangd#2059 -->

**Preprocessor conditional folding**

Each branch of a conditional forms a folding range up to the directive that
ends it, which stays visible

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/05_preprocessor_conditional.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported clangd#1623 -->

**Pragma region folding**

Named pragma regions form folding ranges

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/06_pragma_region.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Pragma classification**

Only the first argument token decides region/endregion

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/07_pragma_classification.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Comment folding**

Multiline block comments and consecutive line comments do not fold yet

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/08_comment_folding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Include region folding**

Consecutive include directives do not form folding ranges yet

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/09_include_region.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Raw string literal folding**

Multiline raw string literals do not form folding ranges yet

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/10_raw_string_literal.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**`using` declaration blocks**

Consecutive using declarations and directives do not form folding ranges yet

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/11_using_declaration_block.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported -->

**Template parameter list folding**

Multiline template parameter lists do not form folding ranges yet

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/12_template_parameter_list.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Template specializations and instantiations**

Written specializations and their members fold; instantiated declarations
reuse the pattern's source locations and do not fold it again

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/13_template_instantiations.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Abbreviated function templates**

Bodies of functions with `auto` or constrained `auto` parameters fold like
any other function

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/14_abbreviated_function_template.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Macro-generated folding**

Braces and access specifiers spelled through macros fold at the invocation
site

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/15_macro_folding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Coroutine bodies**

The written block folds exactly once and the coroutine transformation
wrapper adds no duplicate fold; a coroutine lambda keeps its body fold

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/16_coroutine_body.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Initializer-list constructions**

The constructor's braces and the nested initializer list share delimiters
and fold once; a parenthesized list argument keeps both folds

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/17_initializer_list_construction.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Macro-argument folding**

Code written inside macro arguments folds where it is written

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/18_macro_argument_folding.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Linkage specification blocks**

`extern "C"` blocks form folding ranges, also behind the usual
`__cplusplus` guards

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/19_linkage_specification.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Module fragments and export blocks**

The global and private module fragments and `export` blocks form folding
ranges

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/fold_kinds/20_module_blocks.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->

## Refinements

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ITEMS: refinements -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported clangd#2667 -->

**`collapsedText` placeholder (LSP 3.17)**

Folded ranges can show a summary

> **Client support**: VS Code does **not** support `collapsedText` yet
> ([vscode#70794](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/70794) — still
> open); Neovim with nvim-lsp supports it natively. Clients that do not
> implement this field will silently ignore it — the folding still works,
> only the placeholder text is missing.

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/refinements/01_collapsed_text.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: unsupported clangd#2666 -->

**Declaration-line folding**

Folding cannot yet keep a declaration signature visible

> **Client support**: this depends on the client interpreting
> `FoldingRange.startLine` correctly. VS Code uses the line _after_
> `startLine` as the first hidden line, so setting `startLine` to the
> declaration line achieves the desired effect. However, VS Code still
> leaves the closing `}` on a separate line rather than collapsing it onto
> the signature line
> ([vscode#3352](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/3352) — still
> open). Other clients may differ.

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/refinements/02_fold_from_declaration_line.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: partial -->

**Inactive preprocessor branch indication**

Inactive branches are not visually distinguished or folded automatically yet

Every branch, active or not, has a fold range and can be folded manually.
Knowing which branch is _inactive_ — to dim or auto-fold it — is not
implemented here; that information belongs to the inactive-regions feature.

> **Note**: this overlaps with semantic tokens (inactive code dimming) and
> is partly a client UX concern. The server can mark these ranges with
> `FoldingRangeKind.Region` and clients can choose to auto-fold them.

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/refinements/03_inactive_preprocessor_branch.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- BEGIN CAPABILITY: supported -->

**Single-line constructs stay unfolded**

A fold that hides nothing is noise

```snap
tests/snap/folding_range/refinements/04_single_line_constructs.cpp
```

<!-- END CAPABILITY -->

<!-- END GENERATED ITEMS -->
