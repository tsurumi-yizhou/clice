# Lint

## Overview

clice integrates clang-tidy as a built-in linting engine. `clice lint` runs
the checks of your `.clang-tidy` over the workspace's translation units with a
resident worker pool and prints one merged report.

**Usage**: `clice lint [--workspace <dir>] [--configuration <tag>] [--workers <n>] [--index]`

Runs clang-tidy over every translation unit of the compilation database that
the lint set below admits, prints the merged findings, and exits non-zero when
problems are found. `--index` additionally builds and persists the project
index from the same parses, so a follow-up `clice index` run has nothing left
to do.

Exit codes: `0` for a clean run, `1` when there are findings, `2` when the
run could not complete as asked: the arguments do not parse, a translation
unit failed to run or the index could not be persisted. An interrupted run
exits with `130`.

## What is checked

- Every translation unit the compilation database lists, inside the workspace.
- Every header inside the workspace that the checked units include, subject to
  the `.clang-tidy` header filters (`HeaderFilterRegex`,
  `ExcludeHeaderFilterRegex`, `SystemHeaders`), read exactly as clang-tidy
  reads them.
- Files outside the workspace are never checked, whether or not the build marks
  them as system headers. A rule in `clice.toml` with `lint = false` keeps
  matching files inside the workspace out as well, for example a vendored
  library:

```toml
[[rules]]
patterns = ["third_party/**"]
lint = false
```

Each translation unit takes its configuration from the nearest `.clang-tidy`,
with the inheritance clang-tidy applies. `NOLINT`, `NOLINTNEXTLINE` and
`NOLINTBEGIN`/`NOLINTEND` comments are honored in every file. A header is
checked in every translation unit that includes it, as clang-tidy would; a
finding several units report identically, notes included, appears once in
the report, which is sorted by file and position and keeps the notes
clang-tidy attaches.

## clang-tidy Integration Quality

Issues that affect the quality of clang-tidy diagnostics within a language server:

- [ ] Suppress clang-tidy warnings from macros in system headers ([clangd#1587](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1587), [clangd#2000](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2000))
- [ ] Run checks on preprocessor directives in preamble (header guards, macros) ([clangd#2501](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2501), [clangd#160](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/160))
- [ ] Configurable diagnostic severity per check category ([clangd#1937](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1937))
- [ ] Support loading clang-tidy plugins ([clangd#1458](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1458))
- [ ] Clang static analyzer support ([clangd#905](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/905))
- [ ] Clean up replacements when applying clang-tidy fixes ([clangd#429](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/429))
- [ ] Filter diagnostics by version control diff ([clangd#822](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/822))
- [x] NOLINT / NOLINTNEXTLINE / NOLINTBEGIN-END comment suppression
- [ ] `Diagnostics.ClangTidy` configuration in `.clangd` config
- [ ] Fast-check filtering for clang-tidy performance
- [ ] Fix-it suggestions from clang-tidy as code actions
- [ ] Diagnostic metadata: check name, documentation URL, source tag
