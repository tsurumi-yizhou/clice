# Analyze

## Overview

`clice analyze` reads the persisted index and reports facts a coding agent turns into refactoring decisions. It never builds or times anything: it describes the code, and the agent — with the code at hand — decides what to change. Like `clice query`, it reads the index `clice index` builds and prints JSON on stdout.

**Usage**: `clice analyze <analysis> [--workspace <dir>] [--configuration <tag>] [options]`

## Modules

`clice analyze modules` describes how the directories of a program depend on each other, as the input for partitioning it into C++20 named modules: which cycles stand in the way, which few entities each cycle hangs on, which headers belong elsewhere, and which constructs a mechanical rewrite into modules cannot carry over.

Every file in the scope belongs to a module, by default its directory. A module depends on another when one of its files names an entity a file of the other provides: a spelled name, a name a macro expansion produces in that file, or the template an explicit specialization specializes. The file providing an entity is a header defining it, else a header declaring it, else the source defining it. A dependency from a header is an interface edge, which would become an import of the module's interface; one only from sources is an implementation edge, which never closes a cycle because an implementation unit may import a module above it. Textual fragments such as `.inc` and `.def` files count as part of the files including them. A header only its own module's sources use, directly or through other such headers, is an internal partition: it adds nothing to the module's interface, and none of its dependencies are interface edges.

- `--scope <glob,...>` analyzes only the files the globs match, as workspace-relative paths; by default every indexed file under the workspace outside a dot directory.
- `--depth <n>` names a file's default module by the first `n` segments of its directory instead of all of them.
- `--partition <file>` assigns modules by globs, first match wins: `{"modules": [{"name": "core", "files": ["src/support/**", "src/vfs/**"]}]}`. Files no glob claims keep their directory module.
- `--move <path>=<module>,...` and `--merge <module>+<module>[+...],...` evaluate a hypothetical change without making it.
- `--move-entity <name>=<header>,...` evaluates moving a declaration, with its members and what their definitions name, to another header, existing or new; `#<id>` from the `edge` view picks one of several overloads.
- `--annotation <file>,...` and `--churn-since <date>` weigh the results; see [annotations](#annotations).
- `--view <view>` chooses the answer, `overview` by default.

The overview's hotspots, move candidates and split candidates are capped by `--limit` (20 by default); modules, edges and cycles are always complete.

A move candidate is a header whose users all sit in one other module and that, together with the sources implementing it and the other headers those implement, names nothing of its own module and is named by nothing else there, short of the whole module; those files are listed to move along. A split candidate is a header whose entities fall into groups no consuming module shares, each listed as `name:line`, the first ten by line, with a `count` of all.

### Obstacles

- A header the index holds several row variants of reads differently depending on what includes it; compiled once as a module interface it would keep one reading. `declarationsDiffer` marks variants declaring different entities, a real configuration dependence, and only those count in the overview; `unstable` names what only some variants name, such as the overloads a template's dependent call finds where it is included.
- A header testing a macro in a preprocessor condition without including its definition reads differently compiled alone, silently (`contextMacros`); one expanding such a macro fails to compile alone until it includes the definition (`borrowedMacros`).
- A `static` or anonymous-namespace entity of a header that another file uses, or that the header's own inline code uses, is local to one translation unit once the header is a module interface.
- A forward or friend declaration of an entity another module provides declares a different entity inside a module unit; one of a third-party entity attaches it to the wrong module. `unused` marks those the file never names, which can simply go.
- A declaration in one module's header whose definition sits in another module's source, and an entity several headers define.
- A macro a header defines that a third-party header reads (`configuringMacros`) has to stay ahead of that header's include in the global module fragment.
- A header specializing a third-party template for arguments it does not provide itself (`implicitProviders`) is used by every instantiation without being named, so no edge records those users; it stays where every instantiating unit can import it.
- Explicit specializations of a template from another module are listed too: they are legal, but reachable only where their module is imported.

### Rebuild estimates

Editing a module's interface recompiles every unit of every module importing it, directly or through other interfaces: a module's compiled interface records a hash of each one it imports. `impact` and the overview's totals compare that, counted in translation units, with the units an edit to the header rebuilds today. An edit to an internal partition rebuilds only the sources reaching it, and an edit to a source rebuilds one unit either way. The estimates are conservative and count only the program's sources.

## Annotations

An annotation is a named number per file that weighs the results, the way a profile weighs an optimizer's choices; every result stays meaningful without any.

- `churn` is how often a file changes: by default the commits of the last six months that touched it, from `git log` (`--churn-since <date>` takes any `git log --since` value; an empty value leaves it out). Hotspots and rebuild totals multiply by it.
- `compile_time` is what rebuilding a translation unit costs. Without it every unit counts as one.

An annotation file is `{"name": "compile_time", "unit": "s", "values": {"src/main.cpp": 4.2}}` with workspace-relative paths; one named like a computed annotation replaces it.

## Answers

Every answer is one JSON object, or `{"error": "...", "stale": [...]}` with exit code 1 when the question cannot be answered (no index, an unknown module or file, an invalid glob); an index missing some units fails with those units in `stale`.
