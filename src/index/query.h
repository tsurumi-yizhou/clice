/// Freshness contract — results may be incomplete, by design:
///
///   1. Cursor resolution (turning an offset in the request's file into a
///      symbol) is accurate: callers that hold an open session await its
///      compile first, so the session's file index describes the buffer
///      being pointed at. For closed files the merged shard resolves
///      against its own stored content snapshot — unless the file's own
///      content moved on from it, in which case the cursor is
///      unresolvable (clause 2).
///   2. Every row source carries the hash of the text it indexed, and
///      serves only while that is the file's current content: disk rows
///      (shards, PCH overlay entries) while the disk still holds it (the
///      freshness gate), an open buffer's rows while the buffer does.
///      Rows whose dependencies changed but whose own text did not keep
///      serving — positionally intact, at worst semantically behind — and
///      rows of text that no longer exists never do.
///   3. An open session's own file index serves under clause 2 against
///      the buffer: while its compile is current, or when it compiled the
///      very bytes the buffer holds (a dependency invalidated it, the
///      buffer did not move). Mid-edit it is skipped: unlike closed files
///      its reindex is the next compile, which the current file's request
///      already awaits.
///   4. An open session without a current file index is served by the
///      file's shard under closed-file rules — but only while the buffer
///      is byte-identical to the content the rows were built from. This
///      is what serves documents opened for reading before any compile is
///      invested in them; the moment the buffer diverges the shard
///      withdraws and clauses 1-3 govern again. Arbitration is strict: a
///      current file index always wins over the shard (never both).
