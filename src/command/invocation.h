/// agrees on. A `-cc1` argument list is taken as already expanded; a
/// driver command line goes through the driver without probing for
/// precompiled headers (clang would otherwise turn `-include` into
/// `-include-pch`, see clangd#856). The entry's directory governs
/// relative paths the way an explicit -working-directory does: an
/// explicit one wins, but its own relative value resolves from the
/// entry's directory, like the real driver run from there: `vfs` is moved
/// there, so it must be one the caller owns, never the process's (whose
/// working directory is every thread's). Null when clang rejects the
/// arguments; `diagnostics` received what it said.
