/// Core design property: polling only marks dirty and emits events — it
/// never needs to be complete. A missed change means derived state stays
/// stale for one more poll period at worst; correctness is anchored by the
/// pull side's two-layer DepsSnapshot validation (mtime, then content hash)
/// at compile and index time. That is what lets this implementation stay
/// simple and coarse, and why it polls stat instead of using inotify — for
/// clangd's reasons: portable, no fd limits, no event storms.
///
/// The tracker only observes; it never dispatches. Disk changes surface
/// through the file table's change queue, database changes as the
/// returned batches the polling loops (and the clice/internal/poll test
/// hook) hand to dispatch(), which keeps the tracker unit-testable
/// against plain data structures.
