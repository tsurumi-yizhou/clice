/// The server's language features, each assembled from its providers.
///
/// A feature answer can come from three sources:
///   - the live AST: dispatched to the worker that holds the file's AST;
///   - build-companion caches: products derived while building the PCH
///     (e.g. the preamble's document links), cached master-side because the
///     worker's AST is built on top of the PCH and cannot see the preamble
///     region;
///   - the index: every index source, read through index::IndexQuery.
///
/// Routing is derived per request from readiness, never from a mode
/// flag: a current AST answers as today; otherwise an index source that
/// is byte-identical to the buffer answers immediately (whole-document
/// features through the feature::index_* projections, cursor queries
/// through index::IndexQuery's freshness clauses); otherwise the request awaits
/// the compile the policy owes, or answers honestly empty when it owes
/// none (ServingMode::IndexOnly).
///
/// Every entry takes its Ticket before its first suspension, drains the
/// transport pipe, and answers ContentModified once the ticket goes
/// stale: the client keeps what it has and re-pulls. The one exception is
/// completion, which deliberately serves the drained buffer (see there).
///
/// Discipline: any feature whose answer is assembled from more than one
/// source belongs here. Transports (LSP handlers) only translate
/// between the wire protocol and these methods — they never merge, retry,
/// or gate results themselves.
