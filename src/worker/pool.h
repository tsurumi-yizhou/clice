///     low-priority concurrency is budgeted — the full schedulable capacity
///     when the user is idle, a fixed share of the configured capacity while
///     foreground activity is live, and less under memory pressure. A High
///     request finding no idle slot cooperatively cancels one low build
///     instead of waiting out a whole TU.
///   - Stateful workers keep per-document ASTs; each open document is pinned
///     to one worker (path_id affinity), balanced by document count.
///
/// Responsibility contract — the pool is mechanism, callers are policy:
///
///   - The pool owns PROCESSES and CAPACITY: spawn, monitor, respawn with
///     backoff, per-slot crash budget (streak, healthy-uptime reset),
///     give-up -> cooldown revival, scaling between min/max, preemption
///     under memory pressure, a deadline on every request, scheduling
///     (priority, affinity). Its guarantee: capacity is never permanently
///     zero.
///   - The pool ATTRIBUTES every death. A dying worker names the request it
///     was running (see worker/crash_report.h), or the deadline watchdog
///     names the one it killed the worker for; each request in flight
///     learns whether it is that one. A death that names a request is that
///     request's content's doing and spends no slot budget; only nameless
///     deaths — the process itself failing — count toward the streak.
///   - The pool NEVER retries a request. Requests do not survive a crash;
///     slots do. Retry policy is semantic and lives with the caller —
///     deliver() is the shared form of it.
///   - The dispatch_errc taxonomy is the contract language. worker_crashed:
///     this request killed its worker — the caller blames its content
///     (Error::data carries the dead incarnation's identity so one death is
///     never blamed twice, the message how it died). worker_lost: another
///     request's crash took it along, blameless. worker_died: the death
///     named no request. worker_unavailable: never dispatched, a capacity
///     window — await_capacity() tells when it closes. cancelled:
///     deliberate preemption, requeue freely.
